While respiratory microbes are primarily known to enter the body via the nose and mouth, transmission via the ocular surface-nasolacrimal duct route remains less well understood. This study investigated the microbiota of exhaled breath, the conjunctiva and the anterior nares in a healthy population to assess the potential for microbial transfer from exhalations to the ocular surface.
